# EuroMammalsConnectivity
EuroMammalsConnectivity, a component of the [Natura Connect project](https://naturaconnect.eu/) project, offers tools for Circuitscape-based connectivity analysis in European mammals. This initiative aims to model gene flow and landscape connections, contributing to conservation efforts by identifying key corridors and movement barriers. It utilizes scalable pipelines for diverse data analysis, enhancing the Natura Connect project's mission to support biodiversity through comprehensive connectivity studies.
